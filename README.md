I use GitHub as a working surface for learning, experimentation, and technical writing.

Repositories here document problems, constraints, decisions, and outcomes — not just finished code.  
Current focus includes Python fundamentals, AI tooling (including Tinker by ThinkingMachines.AI), and clear technical explanation.

The goal is traceability of thought, not polish.
